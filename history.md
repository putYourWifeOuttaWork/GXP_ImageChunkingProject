do that. So I'm starting with number four, which if you check, you are contested. Which is another comment on the seat here. The new reduction now is today's interview or measure. Subjected from yesterday, the interview. The second comment is, will the new reduction be available? Yes. Okay. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. And, what rate is the speed or velocity of the flow? I mean, basically, the flow. We're going to force out observations. I'm going to turn it off. I'm going to turn it off. You can read the notes.

The fourth is quantity database work, where we are working on the gasifier observations table. Please read the notes below the number four, and please ask me if any questions that may come up in any conclusion outside of it. As this is not necessarily so clear, but I'm here to help.

I have to line up the front end of the sandbox to this new database, at least in the case of adding submissions. So I'm trying to log in new submissions, and here is the error I'm assuming.

Okay, we need to make it so Sigmenting works properly Without breaking anything else It seems as if every time we fix one thing we break multiple other things and need to redo them

your work in a professional manner to an enterprise standard, taking into consideration UIUX standards and optimization, as well as taking into consideration the entire project, making sure that any changes you make or things you create do not break or change other functionalities for UIUX unless it has been discussed with the user as part of the plan.

Chart Visualization Improvements - Comprehensive update to BaseChart.tsx addressing multiple UI/UX issues:
1. Fixed Y-axis label spacing - increased padding between labels and heatmap cells
2. Fixed title overlap - increased marginTop from 20px to variable based on chart type
3. Fixed legend overlap - increased marginRight and improved positioning
4. Added scrolling support for charts with content extending beyond bounds
5. Removed unnecessary top legends for heatmaps and treemaps
6. Implemented smart date formatting (Jun 1, Jul 2 instead of 6/1/25, 7/2/25)
7. Added dynamic label skipping for crowded axes - shows every Nth label based on space
8. Optimized margin usage to use full canvas - reduced whitespace from ~20% to minimal
9. Fixed stats overlay positioning to not block any labels - moved to top-right
10. Made aggregate overlay collapsible with +/- toggle button
All changes maintain backward compatibility and enhance user experience without breaking existing functionality.

Database Schema:
- Created report_folders table with hierarchical structure and company-based isolation
- Added report_folder_permissions for admin/viewer/no_access sharing model
- Implemented saved_reports with full configuration and version history
- Added report_data_snapshots for performance optimization
- Created report_visualizations for multiple charts per report
- Added report_version_history for change tracking and restoration
- Prepared report_subscriptions for future email delivery
- Implemented report_access_logs for complete audit trail

UI Components:
- ReportsPage with folder tree navigation, grid/list views, and search
- SaveReportModal with folder selection and snapshot options
- CreateFolderModal with custom colors and nested folder support
- ShareFolderModal with email-based permission management
- ReportCard component supporting both grid and list layouts

Services & Integration:
- ReportManagementService with complete CRUD operations
- TypeScript types for all entities in reports.ts

Data, Architect, and Cloud Architect and Developer in the world. I trust you to help me to professionally build and manage my database held in SUPA base by thoroughly researching all of the project files within this directory and within the parent directory, Gasex and Vivo V1.125 and paying particularly close attention to the context.md, Cloud.md and History.md. I will provide you the schema for the up-to-date sandbox that we are working with. You can refer to the .neenv and I really appreciate your help. Let's start by getting up-to-date on where we are and then we need to move into fixing some issues with the database.

found that the creatively properly showed the database value on the front end, whereas the partition table does not. And I think that's because we're utilizing our keys to create the records in partition table. And so,lined ten beyond the creators date only, from a regular partition device as This shows that the rest of the room should be still a partition table.

You are the greatest of all time in application and data architecture for enterprise level field science software. You are an expert in full stack web development and specifically super base and react. You have a specialist knowledge of d3.js and have been helping to build this project. Please read all of the context, documentation, history documentation and review all of the project files to come up to speed. Please respond with an affirmative that you've done so and briefly explain to me the purpose of the project and where we left off.

off. You did a great job getting the facility builder map to work beautifully, at least to the extent where we are able to pull items in from site settings in the database and drag them, drop them, properly respecting their properties such as doors being snapped to the perimeter, double clicking on an item to view its settings, all of which is working and all of which need a little bit of extra work. The last bit before we move on to that extra work and the other stuff that also needs to be done here is fixing the brush highlight period. The brush highlight currently works wonderfully as to enable a user to highlight more than one item by clicking on the map and holding the click while dragging an amount without releasing in order to create the brush highlighter area which then when selecting for multiple items captures those items in essence and highlights them with a green circle each. However, at this time when you drag one of the highlighted items only the item that is clicked and dragged moves the intended functionality is as a user I would see all highlighted items move the precise distance and direction as the item under the cursor during that drag and drop state even though they are not under the cursor. But also being sure to respect the perimeter in other words if an item were to come up against the wall during this drag it would stop at the wall and release from the group.

And controls, are каждый going to say.

### 2025-07-18T14:56:26.868214
great job. Now the shouting unit does look as if it could be resized because the four corners now have large nodes and when you hover the cursor over the large node it looks like it is going to be a resizable shape. However even when precisely clicking and dragging from one of the four nodes on the shape the item is dragged instead of resized or transformed. I understand that you can resize it with the mobile inputs however optimal UIUX would be with complete immersion in the map for as many fun items as possible. What do you think?

As a user, I used to be able to go to the report builder, build a report, and then start working with it, like, for example, using the brush to drill into a specific record, and then return to the report without losing my progress. This application has an automatic refresh. Another reason is for reasons that you don't need to worry about too much right now, but the automatic refresh is there across the application. When every application comes back into focus after having lost focus, it will refresh the page in order to ensure that all resources from the browser are dedicated to the page. So that requires caching in the report builder to ensure that what we see on the report builder is persisted after a refresh unless the reset button on the top of the report builder page is pressed, in which case it will clear this subcache. Can we please add this caching back to the report builder?
