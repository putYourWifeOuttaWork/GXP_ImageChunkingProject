-- Fix created_at timestamp preservation in sync process
-- The issue: created_at has DEFAULT now() on partitioned table, 
-- so inserts without explicit created_at use current timestamp

-- IMPORTANT: This migration fixes the sync process to explicitly preserve created_at timestamps
-- from source tables when syncing to partitioned tables. Without this, all synced records
-- would get the current timestamp instead of their original creation date.

-- First, let's verify the issue
