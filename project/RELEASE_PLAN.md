   - `report_version_history`
   - `dashboards`
   - `dashboard_widgets`

3. **Schema Cleanup**
   - Remove deprecated columns
   - Consolidate redundant tables
   - Update indexes and constraints
   - Add missing foreign keys

#### 3.3 Migration Order
```

3. Feature flags for gradual rollout
4. Monitoring alerts configured
5. Communication plan for issues
```

#### 5.3 Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All migrations tested on staging
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented
- [ ] Error tracking configured
- [ ] Backup procedures verified
- [ ] Support team briefed

### Phase 6: Post-Release (Priority: Medium)

- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Check database health
- [ ] User feedback collection

#### 6.2 Hotfix Readiness
- [ ] Hotfix process documented
- [ ] Emergency contacts listed
- [ ] Quick patch deployment ready

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Database Migrations** - Could cause data loss if not handled properly
2. **Partitioned Tables** - Complex migration with performance implications
3. **Report/Dashboard Data** - User-created content must be preserved
4. **Permission System** - Must maintain security integrity

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Extensive Testing** - All migrations tested multiple times
2. **Gradual Rollout** - Use feature flags for new features
3. **Backup Everything** - Multiple backup points before deployment
4. **Monitor Actively** - Real-time monitoring during deployment

## Critical Path Items

These must be completed before release:

1. **Database Migration Scripts** - Fully tested and reversible
2. **Data Integrity Checks** - No data corruption possible
3. **Performance Validation** - No degradation from current version
4. **Security Audit** - All new endpoints properly secured
5. **Error Handling** - Graceful failures with clear messages

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All automated tests passing
- [ ] No critical bugs in production
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable range
- [ ] Successful rollback test performed
- [ ] User documentation complete
- [ ] Support team trained

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1-2**: 3-4 days (Tech debt & bugs)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 days (Database migration)
- **Phase 4**: 3-4 days (Testing)
- **Phase 5**: 2 days (Deployment prep)
- **Total**: 10-13 days

## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize bug list
2. Create detailed migration scripts
3. Set up staging environment
4. Begin technical debt cleanup
5. Schedule team sync meetings
