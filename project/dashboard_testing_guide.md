# Dashboard Testing Guide - Fixed Issues

## Fixed Issues
1. ✅ Fixed import issue - Changed from named export to default export in DashboardsPage.tsx
2. ✅ Added property mapping from snake_case (database) to camelCase (TypeScript)
3. ✅ Added null checks for optional properties (description, viewCount, rating)
4. ✅ Fixed date handling for formatDistanceToNow

## Testing Steps

### 1. Refresh the Browser
- Clear cache (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
- Navigate to http://localhost:5175/dashboards

### 2. Expected Behavior
The dashboard page should now load successfully showing:
- "Dashboards" header
- "Create Dashboard" button
- Empty state if no dashboards exist

### 3. Create Your First Dashboard
1. Click "Create Dashboard"
2. You'll see a template selection modal:
   - Option to start with blank dashboard
   - Any available templates (if exist in database)
3. Click "Blank Dashboard"
4. Should navigate to /dashboards/new

### 4. In Dashboard Builder
1. Enter a name: "Test Dashboard"
2. Add description (optional)
3. Look for reports in the right sidebar
4. Drag reports onto the grid
5. Resize and arrange widgets
6. Click "Save Dashboard"

### 5. Troubleshooting

If you still see errors:

**No reports in sidebar?**
- First create some reports in the Report Builder
- Navigate to /reports/builder
- Create and save a few test reports

**Database connection issues?**
```bash
# Check Supabase status
cd /path/to/supabase
npx supabase status

# If not running:
npx supabase start
```

**Console errors?**
Check browser console (F12) for:
- Network tab: Failed requests
- Console tab: JavaScript errors

### 6. Quick Database Check
Run in Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Check if tables were created
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE 'dashboard%';

-- Check for any dashboards
SELECT * FROM dashboards;

-- Check for templates
SELECT * FROM dashboard_templates;
```

1. **"Failed to fetch dynamically imported module"**
   - Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Clear browser cache
   - Restart dev server

2. **"Cannot read property of undefined"**
